<h1> Manifesto </h1>


<h2 style="font-weight:bold; border-bottom: 2px solid #E2DCDC"> Mission </h2>
<p> The objective of this site is two-fold:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Give voice to credible ideas bourne by operators, builders and those who roll up their sleeves 
	</li>
	<li>Tell interesting stories backed by interesting analyses or real life case studies</li>
</ul>

<p> 
 Too often nowadays what we find on the internet are long-winded rants without any hard data or interesting analysis.  Or, even worse (and far more often), pieces written by people who don't have any first hand experience about the subject matter they write about.
</p>

<p> So, we decided to create a space, interesting stories can be told by the people that lived them supported by novel analyses or data noone has thought to include.  We live in a world with boundless information - we want to put it to good use. </p>


<!-- <ul>
	<li>
		<span class="highlight_area">Discuss topics executives try to kill by ‘taking the conversation off-line’ </span> - these are the conversations that need to be had, because they pose conflict, and conflict is the lowest common denominator for the barrier to success.   Much like a troop marching to a destination will only reach it as fast as the slowest person will walk - a company will only attain success as quickly as they are able to resolve their biggest conflicts.
	</li> <br>
	
	<li>
		<span class="highlight_area"> Provide case studies of real actions, not generic statements </span>
	</li> <br>
	
	<li>
		<span class="highlight_area">Give voice to the doers, not the hand waivers </span>
	</li> <br>

	<li>
		<span class="highlight_area"> Establish credible insights into business challenges </span>from the people that understand markets and industries, vs. those that claim they do but have never met with a customer or built a product themselves 
	</li> <br>

</ul> -->

<h2 class="highlight_area" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #E2DCDC"> Types of Stories </h2>
	<p> We will focus on writing three types of stories:
	</p>	
	
	<ul>
		<li>		
			<span class="highlight_area">'here's how' </span> - stories, or strategies, for how to change something for the better. But these are not whimsical ideas, rather strategies with supporting data and scenarios for impact.
		</li> <br>
		
		<li>
			<span class="highlight_area">'left unsaid' </span> - situational or case study oriented stories about challenges, conflicts or controversies that need to be resolved in order for success to occur 
		</li><br>
		<li>
			<span class="highlight_area">'by the numbers' </span>- data based assessment of interesting topics, happenings or phenomena 
		</li> <br>
		
	</ul>

<h2 class="highlight_area" style="border-bottom: 2px solid #E2DCDC"> Guiding principles </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>		
			<span class="highlight_area">Our contributors must have walked the walk </span> - our contributors are all people that have had first hand experience with whatever they are writing about.  That means - if we're writing about investing it is by someone who has invested his/her own and other people's money, if it's a startup article it is by someone who has been a part of one in the past. These are not hard and fast rules - a good days labor can come in many ways, but our content comes from people that have lived it.
		</li> <br>
		
		<li>
			<span class="highlight_area">We admittedly can not cover every angle, and we'll be honest about this </span>- every article, or story, will conclude with a list of things/topics/angles we didn’t consider, so that you can understand the limitations, and if you're interested you can know how to explore further on your own. 
		</li><br>

		<li> <span class="highlight_area">Each article will come with data or a case study </span>- to the extent possible we will support our facts either through case study or hard numbers, so as to avoid generalizations and vaguery.
		</li> <br>

		<li>
			<span class="highlight_area">Each article will provide some action you can try </span>- these sections will be known as "so what’s the point?"" - every article must have a tactical piece of advice or an anecdote that the reader can experiment with (doesn’t matter if everyone agrees with it). 
		</li><br>
	
		
	</ul>
