	<h2 class="firstline">	“You have enemies? Good. That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.” </h2>

	<p> A memorable quote from one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century – Winston Churchill.  Without succumbing to hyperbole the message behind this quote is critical for leaders.  </p>

	<p> Above all else a leader’s biggest responsibility is to make decisions.  Whether the decision is right or wrong is not nearly as important as being able to make a decision at all.  This, above most others, is the trait that separates a good leader from an ineffective one, or at worst a bad leader.  There are two main reasons why this trait is so defining:</p>

	<h3 class="firstline"> REASON #1 – ANY DECISION WILL NOT BE 100% SUPPORTED.  WHATEVER THE DECISION, WITHOUT FAIL IT WILL DISAPPOINT SOMEONE. </h3>

	<p> 
	Inevitably in every company there are dissenting opinions.  Good leaders will recognize the challenge and make a choice nonetheless.  Of course, good leaders will make an effort to ensure that even the dissenters are supportive, so as to not sabotage the outcome.  But, ultimately one must accept some strain placed on some relationships - at least in the short term. </p>

	<h4 class="firstline">EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS</h4>
	<p>Let’s consider a few leaders we’ll recognize in our time. The most immediate examples are likely found in the military, but since many of those decisions are made behind closed doors they are hard to come by.</p>

	<p>Sports provides one of the most frequent reminders of tough choices that is on display every single day.  Coaches make tough decisions every game – </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Who gets to be in the starting line up</li>
		<li>Who takes more shots</li>
		<li>…and the most difficult of all – if it’s crunch time, who is the go to guy?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>One of the best coaches and leaders of our time is Phil Jackson. One might argue the choice for him was always easy – give the ball to Michael, give the ball to Kobe.  But there were several moments in his career when he went against the grain.  One of the more memorable moments was <span> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYcjCoy7R4I " style="font-weight:bold;"> giving the final shot of a playoff game to rookie Toni Kukoc over Scottie Pippen </a> </span> who was at that time a 3 time NBA champion, 2 time first defensive team player, All-Star game MVP, an Olympic gold medalist and by all accounts the best player on that Bulls team in Michael Jordan’s absence.  Scottie famously refused to come off the bench in response to this play, only to watch Toni sink the game winner and later admit that Phil made a good call. </p>

	<p>Similarly in business there are many examples of difficult decisions leaders must make – which projects get more investment, which employees receive a promotion, etc.  Most examples are made behind closed doors so it is difficult to single them out.  But, history does provide a few examples of forks in the road where an executive made a call which (without question) must have been challenged by at least some peers.  A more recent example would be <span> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/why-did-snapchat-turn-down-three-billion-dollars" style="font-weight:bold;"> Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel famously turning down a $3bn buyout from Facebook </a> </span> a move that no doubt riled some investors and employees who were eager to cash out.  Today, Snapchat is worth 5x that valuation clearly validating Spiegel’s choice thus far, but also buying him the cache to make bold decisions going forward. </p>

	<p> It should be noted that some decisions turn out to be wrong, in hindsight.  Certainly we are not building a case that a leader is effective so long as decisions are made, even if they are wrong most of the time.  You need to have a decent batting average, but that requires stepping up to the plate.  A leader will have greater credibility and lee way to make bold decisions if there exists a history of making tough calls some of which are successful while others not. </p>

	<h4 class="firstline"> QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS </h4>
	<p>Empirically we know the above to be true based on case studies.  <span style="color:#56a0d3"> In an attempt to quantify this phenomena we looked at the impact of decision making on companies in the Fortune 500 list.</span> The premise being to examine if we can find a correlation between the staying power of an executive team and its ability to make good decisions that positively impact company success. </p>  

	<p> First, we compared the Forbes 1000 list between two time periods – 2015 and 2008 (we needed a time period of at least 5 years to ensure a sufficient passing of time in which executive changes might be made, and the impact of decisions can be observed; 2008 happened to be easily available in excel format). </p>

	<p>
	Next – we chose three sets of companies to review for a total sample size of 15 (see figure 1) </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Companies that moved up most in their position on the list – “Success stories” </li>
		<li>Companies that moved down most in their position on the list – “Fallouts” </li>
		<li>Companies that remained in the same position (+/- a few spots).  For this set of companies we looked only at companies in rank 50 or higher (to manage assumption that at some point it is simply too difficult and the company is too big to easily move up spots; e.g., if you’re a fortune 10 company the ability to move even one spot up is far more challenging than a company sitting at 80)</li>
	</ul>

	<p class="caption"> Figure 1 <br> Sources: Google finance, Forbes.com, Company websites, annual reports</p>

	<p> For each set of companies we compared the number of events that indicate a major decision (e.g., new product release, M&A, partnership, or market entry, etc.) vs. the number of changes in the organizational structure (e.g., new appointments, new roles, etc.).  Finally, we normalized the volume of activity against the size of the company by using number of employees as proxy – to remove bias associated with larger companies naturally having more activity. </p>

	<p>The results are not bullet proof conclusive, but nonetheless allow us to infer some insights relevant to our hypothesis that companies </p>

	<p class="caption"> Figure 2 <br> Sources: Google finance, Forbes.com, Company websites, annual reports, offline analysis</p>


	<p> There appear to be roughly 2 major clusters, and 2 sub-clusters – </p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Cluster 1 – <span style="color:#56a0d3">7 out of 10 companies whose ranking did not change all show high rate of corporate change, yet their ranking did not improve</span>.  These are potentially companies who are either undergoing change for change sake (companies with high volume of activity) or companies whose boards or management teams don’t have enough patience to see some ideas through (companies with low volume of activity). </li>
			<li>Cluster 2 – </li>
			<ul>
				<li> <span style="color:#56a0d3"> Each of the ‘success story’ companies had few corporate changes (compared to other peer groups)</span>, whilst more activity than all but 2 companies from both the ‘place holders’ and ‘fall outs.’  This perhaps an indication that these companies have strong belief in their management team and their decisions </li>
				<li> <span style="color:#56a0d3">3 companies do come from other categories, but these perhaps are the examples of companies with strong management teams</span>, making bets which have not panned out enough to move their ranking ahead </li>
			</ul>
		</ul>

<h3 class="firstline">REASON #2 - THE WORLD IS INUNDATED WITH DATA, WHICH IRONICALLY MAKES QUICK DECISIONS MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN THE PAST.  </h3>

<p> Years ago leaders had to make decisions on imperfect information, which presented its own challenges but in hindsight allowed more room for “instinct” and “gut” decisions.  <span style="color:#56a0d3">Today, the volume of data available can make decisions more informed, but leave ineffective leaders paralyzed</span>.  Ultimately you can always mine for more data, test another scenario - particularly with today’s computing power.  However, your competitors can do the same.  Therefore there has never been a greater premium placed on speed, and leaders who leave themselves at the mercy of data can fall into the trap of over-analysis, while their competitors make decisions that can potentially slingshot them ahead of the pack. </p>

<p> I could place data, graphs and tables in this section to show just how much more information we have at hand today vs. decades past.  But, in the spirit of making a point, I’ll just make a decision and stop the story here believing that hopefully you the reader have probably experienced this phenomenon first hand.  If not, it’s quite likely that you will.</p>

<h3 class="firstline"> SO WHAT? </h3>
<p>If you aspire to be a great leader then above all else be decisive, don’t be afraid to be confrontational and get used to the fact someone won’t like you (at least in the short term).</p>

<div class="admittedlydivider"> </div>

<h3 class="firstline">ADMITTEDLY… </h3>
<ul>
	<li>Just because a company didn’t move ahead in its fortune 1000 ranking that its decisions were bad. Particularly as this analysis does not take into account competition, or market dynamics (note each company was not compared to others in its industry)</li>
	<li>We could have taken a larger sample size </li>
	<li>We could have in greater depth analyzed each of the individual organizational and market changes – we looked at aggregate volume to draw conclusions, rather than examine the context of each change </li>
	<li>We could analyze the average number of data points executives consider in making decisions – this would require some primary research </li>
	<li>We can compare the rate at which some information (e.g., financial information) gets updated today vs. prior decades </li>
